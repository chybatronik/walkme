WalkMe Inc. allows you to easily add interactive on-screen WalkMe™ guidance sequences to your website or HTML software program. Creating and adding a customizable WalkMe™ sequence is remarkably easy and doesn’t require any technical expertise. Our advanced development platform – available as a web browser plug-in – gives you full control over the content, design, placement and functionality of each step of your on-screen guides.

Publishing a WalkMe™ to your target application couldn’t be simpler: you just need to insert a single line of code to your host server (similar to the process for including Google Analytics)…that’s it. Once you’ve added your WalkMe™ – which appears as step-by-step balloon hints on top of your screen content – users can view it without needing to download or install any software.
